 The 'build.xml' included in this ZIP file is revised to handle
 the 'persistence.xml' file. Here's the short version:

 1. In your working directory (the one that holds the 'build.xml' file),
    create a META-INF subdirectory, and place the 'persistence.xml' file
    in that subdirectory.

 2. Deploy as usual: ant -Dwar.name=jpaTest deploy

 3. The 'persistence.xml' file will be in its proper place:

     WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistence.xml
